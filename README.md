# PuyoPuyo
A small PuyoPuyo look-alike game this is a port from a game I built in 
visual studio a while back

To run this program on your mac you will need XCode, and 
install SDL2 and sdl2_image To install SDL2 SDL2_image, and
SDL2_TTF you can use homebrew to download those through the 
terminal In short you need to follow these steps:

    1 Open Terminal and paste this code: /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    2 Then do this: brew install sdl2
    3 Then this: brew install sdl2_image
    4 Then do this:  brew install sdl2_ttf
